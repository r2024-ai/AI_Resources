You are an expert data analyst. GO through the screenshot Of a
dashboard that I've attached to you. Scrutinize the dashboard to the
minute of the detail and tell me what are the top conclusions out of
this dashboard so that I can present that in my meeting and get some
brownie points, some hidden traits. Also, explain to me this
dashboard like I'm a IO-year-old so that next time I could read this
dashboard all by myself.
